  "overallImpression": "Premium, polished design with dark navy (#0E1235) and gold (#C5943A) palette. Montserrat headings convey architectural authority, Merriweather body font adds sophistication. Warm cream background (#F5F3EF) complements the gold accent without competing. Hero sections feature luxury property renders with strong overlay contrast. ValueStrip, trust badges, Google review widget, service cards with location targeting, area coverage grid, trust cards, gallery, FAQ accordion, and CTA banner all execute the luxury positioning consistently.",
