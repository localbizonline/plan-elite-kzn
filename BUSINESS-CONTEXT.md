## Target Customer
Both residential homeowners and commercial property owners/developers in the greater Durban area. Primarily planned work — new builds, renovations, and property upgrades. Not an emergency service. Customers are investing in their properties and expect a premium, professional experience from initial consultation through to handover.

## Business Personality & Tone
Premium, confident, and architecturally authoritative. Plan Elite positions itself as more than a building contractor — they're a full-service property development firm that handles architecture, construction, and interior design under one roof. The tone is polished and aspirational: "Dream Elite — Plan Elite — Build Elite." They set benchmarks for excellence, not bargain pricing. Communication should be professional but approachable, with an emphasis on the complete journey from vision to reality.

## Design Direction
- **Aesthetic:** Luxury/Refined with Industrial undertones. Dark navy and gold palette drawn directly from the Plan Elite logo.
- **Fonts:** Montserrat (heading) / Merriweather (body)
- **Color Feel:** Deep midnight navy paired with warm metallic gold accents — polished, confident, and high-end. The warm cream background complements the gold without competing with the navy headings. This is a premium brand, not a rough trades company.

## Local Context
- **Property types:** Durban suburban homes with lush tropical gardens, face-brick and plastered houses, coastal properties requiring weather-resistant finishes, gated estate developments, commercial retail and office buildings in Umhlanga and Pinetown.
- **SA terminology:** Wendy house, nutec, lapa, braai area, precast walling, palisade fencing, instant grass (kikuyu/LM), DB board, geyser, granny flat, boundary wall.
- **Typical job settings:** Suburban properties in established Durban neighbourhoods, new estate developments in Umhlanga/Ballito, commercial precincts, coastal properties exposed to salt air and humidity.
